		<!-- WIZARDS --> 
		<Loc Key="DES_NINESEVEN" Value="Nineseven" />
		<Loc Key="DES_NINESEVEN_DES" Value="It would be hard to tell now, with all the mechanical replacements, and techmagic trinkets obscuring most of the organic origin, but Nineseven was once an elven archmage and scholar. Throughout her eternal life, she became fascinated with the metalworks of the dwarves and the infinite possibilities of alchemy that can transmute. Some say she is the progenitor of techmagic, others claim she merely mastered it." />
		<Loc Key="DES_NINESEVEN_QUOTE" Value="The flesh binds me no more, magic runs through my wires now. I am the Tech-Master and I shall be more!" />		
		<Loc Key="DES_MORIQUE" Value="Morique" />
		<Loc Key="DES_MORIQUE_DES" Value="Morique the demonsouled, or the possessed, is a dark elven sorceress of great, but dangerous power. As the moniker suggests, she shares her body with a powerful demon. Whether the union is one of mutual understanding, or parasitic infestation, remains unclear. Morique’s ambition does not end with taming her demon, with Death, Chaos at her fingertips she seeks to prove her ultimate dominance over all other Wizards, especially her demon rival, Tauron." />
		<Loc Key="DES_MORIQUE_QUOTE" Value="I have mastered the infernal and We are now more powerful than any, one Wizard, can hope to be!" />
		<Loc Key="DES_GRENDEL" Value="Grendel" />
		<Loc Key="DES_GRENDEL_DES" Value="Grendel may be one of the greatest Wizards, certainly the best of his kind, but his firm belief is that might makes right. He often claims that anything can be beaten into submission, even magic itself. Grendel does of course use the very basics of the Arcane arts and does dabble in Nature when needed, but he relies mostly on the physical power of his troops." />
		<Loc Key="DES_GRENDEL_QUOTE" Value="I'll make your heads sparkle without magic and then you'll see who's Master!" />

		<Loc Key="DES_NINESEVEN_GREETINGS" Value="The customary formula requires me to greet you, although I see little sense in such civility considering our end game. I am Nineseven, we may speak now."/>
		<Loc Key="DES_MORIQUE_GREETINGS" Value="We greet you, Wizard. We, no,  I am Morique and I am here to master this contest, but until the time comes, let us speak."/>
		<Loc Key="DES_GRENDEL_GREETINGS" Value="Oh, Wizard. No funny stuff with me. I am Grendel, I will beat you."/>

		<Loc Key="DES_TAURON_GREETINGS_MORIQUE_1" Value="A most gracious greeting to you. I am Tauron... Mori, it's you. You always said you will challenge me here, but I always hoped it would not come to pass. But for now at least, my love, we may speak without malice."/>
		<Loc Key="DES_TAURON_GREETINGS_MORIQUE_2" Value="Mori, my heart bleeds for what we must endure... Let us talk for now."/> 
		<Loc Key="DES_MORIQUE_GREETINGS_TAURON_1" Value="It is us, Morique, as we have said to you when our infernal paths parted, we, I, am here to show you my true power! Although now that you stand before me, my red devil, I am saddened that it must be so..."/>
		<Loc Key="DES_MORIQUE_GREETINGS_TAURON_2" Value="My red devil, the final battle looms. Soon only blood will remain between us, and not in the good way..."/>

Or at least that is the official line. The soultrapped claim that their awakening came from a divine source and that they are not some by-product of another’s play. In either case, the soultrapped combine machine and magic in unsettling ways, but they are a race that prefers peace and prosperity to warfare." />
