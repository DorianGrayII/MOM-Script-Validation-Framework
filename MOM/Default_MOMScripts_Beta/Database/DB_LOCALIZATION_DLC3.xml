		<Loc Key="DES_BELIT_DES" Value="Once a mighty ruler of the orcs alongside Bladud, Belit did not approve of her kin becoming more docile in the name of civilised conduct. Instead, she sought to return them to a time of blood and conquest. Alas, the betrayal of her royal bloodline or perhaps a hex from a scorned love, brought about the great curse that turned Belit and her pirate kin into scourgers. But for Belit, being the damned was no obstacle. She has embraced her new state and will challenge anyone who thinks it a weakness. The pirate queen favours raising cities and gives great boons for doing so. She has mastered Death and Sorcery and seeks to show all the other Wizards the power of her cursed destiny! " />

He then claimed the mastery of higer magic, which allowed him to truly tame the seas and become a Wizard himself.  As he rose to the rank of the Sea Tamer, he now prides himself as a master Tactician and a Sea Master able to ambush his enemies and command his powerful sea fleets. Horatio is determined to prove that his soldier’s discipline and training will raise him to the rank of Master. " />

But a day came when he faced the true threat of the Wizards and he knew then that he needed to rise above to truly defend the waters he loved. With Death and Nature now on his side, Gayn protects the waters and bends the seas to his will. He is known to enjoy hunting pirates and dangerous sea creatures, thus earning him the title Sea Hunter. Years of experience as a sailor now benefit those under his command with greater water speed as well as advantages in sea combat. " />
