He is also a master Alchemist, which allows him to interconvert Gold and magical Power at no cost. Jafar’s travel-worn visage is thus likely a mere mirage, one of many he chooses to show. This of course begs the question: what is his true face and design?" />

		<Loc Key="DES_HORUS" Value="Horus" />
		<Loc Key="DES_HORUS_DES" Value="Horus was born with natural talents for the arcane and soon mastered the arts of Sorcery and Life magic. Despite his clear might, he seems unsure of his own potential and thus can be unpredictable in his dealings with other Wizards. Horus is also an Archmage, which makes him particularly effective at casting spells, as well as making his spells tougher to dispel." />

Although he leads the life of a mercenary, he actually gives away his Gold to his master and prefers a simple, austere life.

		<Loc Key="DES_SHURI_DES" Value="{0} is a skilled ranger as well as an accomplished tracker. Her friendly demeanour and dishevelled look can be very misleading, as the huntress is actually tough as nails when it comes to survival.

		<Loc Key="DES_MALLEUS_DES" Value="{0} is a spellcaster of great power and a taste for the destructive and brutal magics. It is said that the slightly unhinged magician may be a dwarf who defied his race’s disdain for magic, but truly, it is hard to tell, as his body is clearly twisted by the wayward power of Chaos, constantly coursing through his arcane veins.

		<Loc Key="DES_JAER_DES" Value="{0} is a high elf spellcaster, specialising in air and wind magic. He is young by elven standards, and would normally remain in his college of magic were it not for his thirst for constant travelling. It is perhaps his natural affinity to air that makes {0} yearn for the travel and change. His interests and loyalties can be described as fleeting by his own kind, but he remains a good mercenary while he stays. " />

		<Loc Key="DES_MARCUS_DES" Value="{0} is sometimes referred to as the man in tights, but he does not seem phased by this and claims the tights allow him far better flexibility in all types of situations. He is a man of many talents, especially useful in the wilderness, active as a tracker or scout. {0} prides himself as a master bowman, and in this he is dead set on proving his worth above all others.

Descendant from dragons, he is an intimidating foe and thus, a great ally to have at your side. {0}, like his ancestors, has an affinity for treasure, and so he has embarked on a life of adventure to accumulate wealth.
