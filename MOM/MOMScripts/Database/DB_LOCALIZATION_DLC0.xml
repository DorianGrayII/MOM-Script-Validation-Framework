		<Loc Key="DES_BLADUD_DES" Value="Bladud used to be a great orc general, then a king of legend. He ruled his kin with his fierce queen Belit, for centuries, before the two parted ways and Bladud claimed the mantle of Wizard.

Through the dark arts of orcmancy, the Wizard has gained great power, and decided to use all of it solely for the purpose of uplifting his people from the mundane into a fearless army of Death. Orcs under Bladud’s leadership can feed off their enemies' life-force and the Wizard himself gains strength from his fallen orc armies. With such a power, the orcs are sure to lead Bladud to his Mastery." />
